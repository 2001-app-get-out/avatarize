# Avatarize

Mobile app for all your silly user avatar needs.

Maybe you're starting an anonymous twitter for your baby sourdough starter and you want an avatar that has _a_ face but not _your_ face. Maybe your old friends have roped you into Discord while you're all quarantined and you've decided you'd rather look like a literal square than a figurative square. Maybe you just want to give your little brother googly eyes in your contacts list. Avatarize can help! (We won't judge.)

DISCLAIMER: the Avatarize team is not responsible for any opportunity costs you may accrue if you change your LinkedIn profile picture to a potato. Please avatarize responsibly.

## Getting Started

This project is made with Flutter. Check out [the flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs) if anything's confusing. An understanding of [MobX](https://mobx.netlify.com/) may also help.

## Building

To generate MobX boilerplate files, run the command:

`flutter packages pub run build_runner build`

If you want to keep this running in the background, you can use

`flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs`
