# Image Editing

The current sketch has three different kinds of ingredient that contribute to the final look of the image:

**Filters** are one-tap wonders that change the look of the image. Their only option (if that?) is a 0-100% intensity. You can't have more than one active filter -- it doesn't make sense for the image to be both sepia and vibrant.

**Adjustments** are edits to the image that come with their own sub-options. Different adjustments might have different numbers or types of options as input. You can have any number of active adjustments on the same image -- it's fine to correct the tilt and also up the brightness.
 - Crop
 - Pan
 - Tilt

**Decorations** are anything that's drawn on top of the image. Stickers and doodles are both decorations.
 - *Facial recognition* counts as a subtype of decorations. It just places the decorations for you
 - Stickers
 - Doodles
